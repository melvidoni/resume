As a Software Development Lead at eWater Group, I manage the web and desktop software teams, ensuring the quality and reliability of our scientific software products. I have over 13+ years of experience in software engineering, having consulted across a wide range of companies to direct their agile transformation and product roadmap. Some of the companies include a variety of factories, start-ups, legacy modernisation opportunities, and video-game independent developers.

I graduated from [Universidad Tecnologica Nacional (UTN)](https://www.frsf.utn.edu.ar/) as an Information Systems Engineer. Years later, I received my PhD _summa cum laude_ on the same institution. I am currently _on leave_ from my position as Lecturer at the Australian National University in the CECS School of Computing, having worked at other universities and research institutes before. I have over a 11+ years of experience as an academic, with a particular focus on the quality, technical debt, and development process if _scientific software_. My main areas of research technical debt management in scientific software and software quality, collaborating with international partners in Canada and Germany. 


I'm also an Editorial Board Member of Information and Software Technology (since 2022), and four times recognised as an ACM Distinguished Reviewer.
