## 2018/06/01: First Meetup
Introduction to R-Ladies and first meetup of the chapter. I introduced what is R, its history, how R-Ladies came to be, its structure and goals, and set up some time to network among the new members.

## 2018/07/04: R for Data Science From Scratch
This was a practical workshop of 2.5hs, based on the book ["R Programming for Data Science"](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) by Roger Peng. It started with the basics, such as _what is a variable_, and we made some very basic plots using `ggplot2`. The idea was to introduce the members to programming, as most of them came from diverse backgrounds and had never programmed before.

## 2018/09/11: Basic Machine Learning Algorithms in R
Introducing three basic Machine Learning Algorithms in R: Classification and Regression Trees, Association Rules and Clustering. The venue was Santa Fe Activa, a venue for local enterpreuneurs, which I secured through negotiations with the Secretary of Small Enterprises from Santa Fe City. The 2.5hs long workshop included explanations about the algorithms, live coding and exercises to solve as "homework".
