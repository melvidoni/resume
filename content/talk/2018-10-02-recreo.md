We introduced amazing women who contributed to science, such as Grace Hopper, Hedy Lammar, Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie among others. We talked about why Open Data is important and how it can affect their lives as citizens; then, we did live-coding to analyze a dataset regarding women studying STEM careers in Argentina."

This talk was given thanks to the [invitation of Fernanda Benitez, who works at the Science and Technology Ministery of Santa Fe Province](https://www.facebook.com/RLadiesSantaFe/notifications/?section=activity_feed&subsection=mention&ref=notif&target_story=S%3A_I778673005598840%3A1587650938034372). I am really grateful for this opportunity.
