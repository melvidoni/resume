**Goal:** Mining Software Repositories (MSRs) have become popular as evidence-based software engineering research that allows gathering and analysing large datasets of software-related data. This project studies MSRs as a methodology, to determine evidence-based processes and guidelines to conduct them, review studies using them, and assess the dichotomy of 'privacy vs utility' when striving for reproducibility.

**Participants:** _Dr. Melina Vidoni_, Dr Nicolás Díaz-Ferreyra.

**Students:** Ms Linda Kwan (ANU, 2022)
