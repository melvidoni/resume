**Goal:** The project objective was to develop software system prototype that would act as a framework to easily integrate planning and scheduling mathematical optimization models for manufacturing processes, to an organization Enterprise System. Key qualities of the prototype were: the ability to change models easily without requiring reprogramming, and a simple and configurable set up of the Enterprise System to interoperate with.

This project was the Thesis from my Information Systems Engineering degree.

**Participants:** Melina Vidoni, Dr. Maria Analia Rodriguez (Co-Advisor), Prof. Aldo Vecchietti (Advisor).
