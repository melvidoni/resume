**Goal:** This project aims to study Advanced Planning Systems (APS) from a Software Engineering (SE) point of view, aiming to bridge the current gap in research, providing sound concepts and definitions founded in current international SE standars. It aims to:

  - To provide a definition that would consider APS as systems and not only as models, including generic Functional Requirements and Quality Attributes.
  
  - Propose means to improve exchange of manufacturing information with Enterprise Systems by using the standardized concepts of the ANSI/ISA-95 standard.
  
  - Generate and evaluate a Reference Architecture to characterize the APS domain and simplify future in-house development of APS modules in SME (Small and Medium Enterprises).

This project was my PhD thesis. Degree: PhD on Information Systems Engineering.


**Participants:** Eng. Melina Vidoni, Prof. Jorge Marcelo Montagna (Co-Advisor), Prof. Aldo Vecchietti (Advisor).
