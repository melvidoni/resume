**Goal:** Many studies related to empirical Software Engineering (SE) are often conducted over object-oriented programming (OOP) projects, with an special focus on Java. This covers a myriad of topics, such as project management and up to code-related issues such as technical debt and maintainability. However, there are many more programming paradigms besides OOP. SE topics can and should be studied in other areas, such as in R programming.


**Participants:** 
- _Dr. Melina Vidoni_, Australian National University, Australia.
