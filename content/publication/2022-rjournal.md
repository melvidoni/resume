title: 'Software Engineering for R Programming + Rejoinder'
authors: ["Melina Vidoni"]

abstract: "Although R programming has been a part of research since its origins in the 1990s, few studies address scientific software development from a Software Engineering (SE) perspective. The past few years have seen unparalleled growth in the R community, and it is time to push the boundaries of SE research and R programming forwards. This paper discusses relevant studies that close this gap Additionally, it proposes a set of good practices derived from those findings aiming to act as a call-to-arms for both the R and RSE (Research SE) community to explore specific, interdisciplinary paths of research."
