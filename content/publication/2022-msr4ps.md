## Abstract

On behalf of the Program Committee, we are pleased to present the proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Mining Software Repositories for Privacy and Security (MSR4P&S 2022). MSR4P&S is co-located with the ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE). This year, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, MSR4P&S (as part of ESEC/FSE) is held virtually with an adapted program that will bring together international researchers to exchange ideas, share experiences, investigate problems, and propose promising solutions concerning the application of Mining Software Repositories (MSR) to investigate the different stages of privacy and security. The workshop topics cover a wide range of MSR applications for cybersecurity research, including empirical and mixed-method approaches, as well as datasets and tools.
