## Open Honours Positions:

I am looking for Honours Students to work at ANU in 2022. Please, contact me via email with a detailed resume, and an analysis of one of my latest papers (2020+) that may interest you. You can find [my publications here](/publication). Just like above, female (or female-identifying) candidates will be prioritised.
