## Open PhD Positions:

_Please don’t contact me until you have read this page. Applications that do not follow the steps outlined here will not obtain a response._


**What:**  _Two fully-funded PhD positions_ with Dr Vidoni as a supervisor at ANU CESC School of Computing. Your PhD will be in Software Engineering, in the intersection of technical debt for data science software. There are two topics available, so please keep reading.

**Duration:** A PhD requires 3 years full-time to complete. You need to ensure you can stay for that period and complete your candidacy.

**Requisites:** 

-  The candidate must be admissible with a fee waiver. <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/phd-mphil" target="_blank">Please carefully read the information provided by our College before you do anything else</a>. In the section _Pre-application process > Step 1_, you will find a self-assessment of eligibility. If you are eligible, then read the rest and continue on this page. 
  
- You must be able to move into Australia for commencement.
  
- If the above two apply, then please continue reading. Anybody is welcome to apply. However, female candidates (or female-identifying) are especially encouraged to submit.


**When:** The successful applicant will be directed for immediate commencement. Ideally, January/February 2022. As a result, _applications will be assessed on a first-come-first-served_ basis. If you want to apply, do it quickly.


### How to Apply:

In the body of your email (link is on the homepage), you will need to show that you have some understanding of what I do, demonstrate that you’ll bring something interesting, and that you’ve identified something in the offered topics that particularly intrigues you. Briefly summarise your academic background and work experience, describe highlights such as the courses that you found most inspiring or challenging. To signal to me that you have read this carefully, start your subject line with “[PhD Application][Project]” (the name of the project is below, so you’ll have to find it), and include the word planipennate somewhere in the email body.

You will have to include the following documents _about you_:

- A current resume, including publications (if existent) and GitHub/GitLab (if existent).
- 2-3 academic letters of recommendation, including contact details (if you are successful, you’ll need 3 people for the application).
- Evidence that you qualify for a fee waiver for an ANU PhD.
- Evidence of your English level (if you have it).

Additionally, you will have to include the following documents _about the project_:

1. _Project: Reproducibility._ Attach a 1-2 page essay (11pt Arial font) discussing your thoughts about this paper: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2018.021651343" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2018.021651343</a>. If you choose this project, you will not submit point 2 and skip to point 3-4.

2. _Project: Testing._ Attach a 1-2 page essay (11pt Arial font) discussing your thoughts about this paper:
<a href="https://melvidoni.rbind.io/publication/2021-rttd-icse/" target="_blank">https://melvidoni.rbind.io/publication/2021-rttd-icse/</a>. If you choose this project, you will not submit point 1 and continue to points 3-4.

3. Select only one of the following open-source datasets (again, only one). Wrangle the data, and create one single plot to rule them all (elaborated, meaningful, clear, aesthetic). Your document must have the plot, discuss the information presented, and why it is relevant (1-2 pages only). The datasets are not related to the papers above, so don't try to cross them. Datasets: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1226698" target="_blank">Option 1</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3906955" target="_blank">Option 2</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1201544" target="_blank">Option 3</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4739069" target="_blank">Option 4</a>.

4. _Optional, but encouraged._ Pick a fiction book you have read and love. Discuss, in 1 page, what you don’t like about that book. It doesn’t matter if the book is old, not translated to English, or not mainstream; I don’t care about the book’s genre as long as it is fiction.  If you cannot pick a book, then comics, visual novels, animated series, TV series, even story-based games will do. Why do this? It is difficult to be critical of things we love, and art is especially subjective. In research, critical thinking is a fundamental skill. Besides, if I read the book, this will be a great icebreaker.


If I hear from you, my first consideration will be whether you are genuinely interested in my research. I will also note whether you’ve taken the time to carefully read these instructions. Please don’t expect a response if you have not.

These requirements may sound onerous, but remember that a PhD is an enormous commitment, both for you and your advisor. Taking the time to carefully and thoughtfully engage with prospective advisors is an investment that is sure to pay off greatly as you embark on this academic adventure.
