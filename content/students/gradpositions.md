## General PhD Information:

At this moment I do not have any pre-funded positions available. As a result, if you are interested in working with me, you must:

- Be admissible with a fee waiver, otherwise you will not be able to apply for scholarship. <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/study/phd-mphil" target="_blank">Please carefully read the information provided by our College before you do anything else</a>. In the section _Pre-application process > Step 1_, you will find a self-assessment of eligibility. If you are eligible, then read the rest and continue on this page. 
  
- You must be able to move into Australia for commencement.
  
- Have already scouted and selected a scholarship to apply for. Do note that you need to have reasonable chances of being granted the scholarship. You will also need to contact me about 3-4 months _before_ the scholarship closing deadline.



### How to Apply:

In the body of your email (my email is on the homepage), you will need to show that you have some understanding of what I do, demonstrate that you’ll bring something interesting, and that you’ve identified something in the offered topics that particularly intrigues you. Briefly summarise your academic background and work experience, describe highlights such as the courses that you found most inspiring or challenging. To signal to me that you have read this carefully, start your subject line with “[PhD Application]”, and include the word planipennate somewhere in the email body.

You will have to include the following documents _about you_:

- A current resume, including publications (if existent) and GitHub/GitLab (if existent).
- Your transcript, in English.
- Two academic letters of recommendation, including contact details (if you are successful, you’ll need 3 people for the application).
- Evidence of your English level (if you have it).


Additionally, you will have to include the following documents _about the project_:

1. Attach a 1-2 page essay (11pt Arial font) discussing one of my papers. You can pick any [paper available here](/publication). If the PDF is not available, you may write to enquire about it.

2. Select _only one_ of the following open-source datasets. Wrangle the data (in either Python or R), and create one single plot to rule them all (elaborated, meaningful, clear, aesthetic). Your document must have the plot, discuss the information presented, and why it is relevant (1-2 pages only). The datasets are not related to the papers above, so don't try to cross them. Datasets: <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1226698" target="_blank">Option 1</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3906955" target="_blank">Option 2</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1201544" target="_blank">Option 3</a>, <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4739069" target="_blank">Option 4</a>. _Note that you can use either Python or R to analyse this dataset_.

3. Pick a fiction book you have read and love. Discuss, in 1 page, what you _don’t like_ about that book. It doesn’t matter if the book is old, not translated to English, or not mainstream; I don’t care about the book’s genre as long as it is _fiction_. If you cannot select a book, then comics, visual novels, animated series, TV series, even story-based games will do. Why to do this? It is difficult to be critical of things we love, and art is especially subjective. In research, critical thinking is a fundamental skill. Besides, if I read the book (or watched the series), this will be a great icebreaker.


If I hear from you, my first consideration will be whether you are genuinely interested in my research. I will also note whether you’ve taken the time to carefully read these instructions. Please don’t expect a response if you have not.

These requirements may sound onerous, but remember that a PhD is an enormous commitment, both for you and your supervisor. Taking the time to carefully and thoughtfully engage with prospective advisors is an investment that is sure to pay off greatly as you embark on this academic adventure.
