abstract: "Context: Technical Debt (TD) is a metaphor used to describe code that is ``not quite right." Although TD studies have gained momentum, TD has yet to be studied as thoroughly in non-object-oriented or scientific software such as R. R is a multi-paradigm programming language, whose popularity in data science and statistical applications has amplified in recent years. Due to R's inherent ability to expand through user-contributed packages, several community-led organizations were created to organize and peer-review packages in a concerted effort to increase their quality. Nonetheless, it is well-known that most R users do not have a technical programming background, being from multiple disciplines."
